<P>This section contains general information about this manual and Ayam.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc1.1">About this Manual</A>
</H2>

<P>As this document is a reference manual, it is
probably pointless to read it from the beginning to the end
(except maybe for the next section, explaining the basics of the
user interface).
Instead, just look up the documentation of the things you are interested
in via the table of contents or the index. Cross references will then
guide you to other important parts of the documentation.
Again: this manual has a rather large index, please use it
(see section 
<A HREF="ayam-9.html#index">Index</A>)!</P>
<P>This document is organized in the following way:</P>
<P>After this first introductory section, the user interface of Ayam is
explained and basic handling instructions for the application are
given in the second section.<BR>
In the third section all interactive modelling actions are documented.<BR>
The fourth section details all object types and object properties,
followed by documentation on all NURBS modelling tools in the fifth
section.<BR>
In the sixth section the Tcl scripting interface is explained and the
following seventh section has all information about the import and export
plugins.<BR>
The eighth section is the dreaded miscellaneous section that
contains documentation not fitting elsewhere.</P>
<P>In this manual, the following typographic conventions are used:
<UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc1.2">About Ayam</A>
</H2>

<P>Ayam is a free 3D modelling environment for the RenderMan Interface,
distributed under the modified BSD licence (no advertisement clause).</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>History</H3>

<P>Ayam is in development since 1997 and was formerly known as
<CODE>"The Mops"</CODE>. Ayam formed the software base of the
authors PhD work. New versions of Ayam were released in
approximately half year intervals since.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>Features Overview</H3>

<P>Here is a short summary of the Ayam feature set:
<UL>
<LI>RIB (RenderMan Interface Bytestream) export and import.</LI>
<LI>Support for NURBS curves, interpolating and approximating curves,
(trimmed) NURBS surfaces, interpolating surfaces, bilinear and bicubic
patches and patch meshes,
Boxes, Quadrics (Sphere, Disk, Cylinder, Cone, Hyperboloid, Paraboloid
and Torus), MetaBalls, polygonal meshes, subdivision meshes and more.</LI>
<LI>All primitives may be combined with the common
CSG-operations: Intersection, Difference, and Union.</LI>
<LI>NURBS modelling includes extrude, revolve, sweep, birail, skin,
and gordon operations (with caps, holes, and bevels) realized as
Tool-Objects (see also section
<A HREF="ayam-8.html#toolobj">The Modelling Concept Tool-Objects</A>).</LI>
<LI>Wavefront OBJ export and import, Rhino 3DM export and import,
AutoCAD DXF export and import, Web3D X3D export and import, Apple
Quicktime 3D Metafile (3DMF) export and import.</LI>
<LI>Custom objects that may freely implement their representations
(using OpenGL and RIB) and even small GUIs to edit their type specific
parameters may be written by the user and dynamically loaded at runtime.</LI>
<LI>Scripting interfaces: Tcl, JavaScript, Lua.</LI>
<LI>Script objects.</LI>
<LI>Miscellaneous: (automatic) instancing, arbitrary number of modelling
views, object clipboard, independent property clipboard, console,
n-level undo.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Since Ayam 1.12, dynamic loading of custom objects and certain plugins
are also available on the Win32 platform (they were not available
before).</P>
<P>Ayam is primarily aimed at the Linux, IRIX, and Win32 platforms.
On those platforms BMRT (Blue Moon Rendering Tools, a RenderMan
compliant renderer by Larry Gritz) is available.
Even though the distribution of BMRT is stopped it is still
the recommended renderer for Ayam.
Despite of this, Ayam may be used on many more platforms with any
RenderMan compliant renderer.</P>
<P>For platforms where BMRT is not available (e.g.&nbsp;FreeBSD or NetBSD), Ayam
may be compiled with code from the Affine Toolkit with limited
functionality (see also the file INSTALL).
In this case, no parsing of slc compiled shaders will be possible.</P>
<P>Since Ayam 1.6 it is also possible to completely replace the BMRT shader
parsing and RIB writing code with code from the Aqsis project, thus
completely eliminating the need for BMRT. Furthermore, shader parsing
plugins are available for all major RenderMan compliant renderers allowing
a tight integration of Ayam with any of those renderers.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="coords"></A> Coordinate Systems and Units</H3>

<P>Ayam uses a right-handed coordinate system as used by OpenGL
but as opposed to RenderMan (the latter is using a left-handed
coordinate system).</P>
<P>In the default modelling view of type <CODE>"Front"</CODE>, the positive
X-axis points to the right, the positive Y-axis points upwards
and the Z-axis points outside the screen, to the user.

</CENTER>
</P>
<P>All coordinate values in Ayam are dimensionless. It is up to the
user to define what a value of 1.0 means: e.g.&nbsp;one centimeter
or one meter.</P>
<P>Due to the limited precision of floating point arithmetics used in Ayam,
coordinate values should be defined in the range between -10.0 and 10.0
for most accurate results.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="rats"></A> Rational Style</H3>

<P>Ayam stores rational coordinates in <EM>euclidean</EM> rational style,
i.e.&nbsp;the weight of a control point is not pre-multiplied with the
coordinates (this will be done internally when handing the coordinates
over for drawing or export purposes).</P>
<P>In Ayam versions prior to 1.19 the weights were always multiplied
with the coordinate values (i.e.&nbsp;<EM>homogeneous</EM> rational coordinates)
to allow faster drawing with OpenGL/GLU, which expects rational
coordinate values to be delivered this way.
But a negative side effect of this approach was that modification
of coordinates or weights for modelling purposes was unnecessarily
complicated.<BR>
Ayam can still display the coordinates in both styles, controlled by
the preference option <CODE>"RationalPoints"</CODE> (see also section
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#prefmodel">Modelling Preferences</A>), but internally
the coordinates are kept in euclidean rational style.<BR>
Scene files from older versions of Ayam are converted automatically to the
new rational style when read by Ayam 1.19 and above, but loading of
scene files written by Ayam 1.19 and above into older versions of
Ayam requires manual intervention (e.g.&nbsp;by means of a script).</P>
