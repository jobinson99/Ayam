<P>This section contains the documentation of the interactive modelling
actions available in Ayam.</P>
<P>Before invoking any modelling action one or more objects should be
selected using the object hierarchy in the main window, the pick action,
or selection manipulating keyboard shortcuts.</P>
<P>Every action can be started with a key press (a shortcut) when
the keyboard focus is in a view window or by clicking on the associated
button in the toolbox window.
Using a keyboard shortcut starts that action in the current view only,
the other views are not affected. In multi window GUI mode, starting an
action from the toolbox window will cause the action to be started in all
view windows that are currently open simultaneously. In single window GUI
mode, the action will be started in the current internal view only
(unless <CODE>"AutoFocus"</CODE> is enabled).</P>
<P>It is perfectly ok to start and work with many different actions at
the same time in different views: one can have e.g.&nbsp;a view, where objects
are moved, a second where objects are rotated and a third, where objects
are picked. The layout, drawing style, and grids may also differ between
the different views. Together with the feature, that the selection may be
changed while actions are active and even panning and zooming of views
is possible (using the rightmost and middle mouse buttons respectively) while
actions are active and without breaking them, this is the key to
unsurpassed flexibility in modelling using Ayam.</P>
<P>To break an action, the <CODE>&lt;Esc&gt;</CODE> key may be used.</P>
<P>The default action for all views, which is also in effect after
use of the <CODE>&lt;Esc&gt;</CODE> key, is <CODE>"None"</CODE>, <CODE>"Pick"</CODE>, or
<CODE>"Edit"</CODE> (depending on the preference
setting <CODE>"Modelling/DefaultAction"</CODE>).
See section
<A HREF="#objsel">Selecting Objects by Picking</A>
for more information about picking objects.</P>
<P>Note that modelling actions that are directly modifying transformations
or points are not available in perspective views, but selection actions
and also the numeric point editing action do work fine.</P>
<P>If an action is in effect for a view, the views title will be changed
appropriately.</P>
<P>A modelling action is performed by clicking into the view with the
leftmost mouse button to mark a point in space or to pick a vertex
and then by dragging the mouse.</P>
<P>You may undo/redo the effects of a modelling action using <CODE>&lt;Ctrl+z&gt;</CODE>
and <CODE>&lt;Ctrl+y&gt;</CODE> (see section
<A HREF="ayam-8.html#undos">The Undo System</A> for more information).</P>
<P>Grids are available to restrict the modelling actions to certain
points and help in exact modelling.</P>
<P>Also note that the middle and rightmost mouse buttons may be used
to zoom and move the view while modelling actions are active.</P>
<P>For actions that modify the camera of a view please see section
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#vwsc">View Window Shortcuts and Actions</A>.</P>

<H2><A NAME="objorpnt"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc3.2">Transforming Objects or Selected Points</A>
</H2>

<P>Many modelling actions either work on objects transformation attributes
or coordinates of selected points. Since Ayam 1.30 this is
controlled implicitly by the point selection: if editable points are selected,
they will be transformed instead of the object.
If there are objects with <EM>and</EM> without selected editable points in the
selection, the latter will not be transformed at all.</P>
<P>Using the preference setting <CODE>"ScopeManagement"</CODE>  (see section
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#prefmodel">Modelling Preferences</A>) a
explicit scope management mode can be enabled.
For this mode there are two keyboard
shortcuts: <CODE>&lt;o&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;p&gt;</CODE>.
<CODE>&lt;o&gt;</CODE> switches to object transformations and <CODE>&lt;p&gt;</CODE> to
point transformations.
These shortcuts can be used anytime, even in the middle of any other
actions. If points are to be modified, a little red point will appear
in the modelling mode icon in the view menu as shown in the image
below:</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>Note that those shortcuts just switch the current view, to modify all
open views, just press <CODE>o</CODE> or <CODE>p</CODE> twice:
<CODE>&lt;oo&gt;</CODE> and <CODE>&lt;pp&gt;</CODE>.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.21."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Also note that the modelling scope may also be toggled by clicking
on the modelling mode icon with the rightmost mouse
button or by starting the action using this mouse
button.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.26."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>


<H2><A NAME="objsel"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc3.3">Selecting Objects by Picking</A>
</H2>

<P>This section describes techniques that can used for selecting
one or more objects within a view window with the mouse.</P>
<P>When the view windows action is <CODE>"Pick"</CODE>, objects
that appear within this view can be selected with the mouse.
This action may be invoked by pressing <CODE>&lt;P&gt;</CODE>
or by making this action the default action using the preference
setting <CODE>"Modelling/DefaultAction"</CODE>. If picking is the
default action, it will be automatically enabled when any other
action is broken using <CODE>&lt;Esc&gt;</CODE>.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="oneobjsel"></A> Selecting Individual Objects</H3>

<P>Selecting objects within a view is a straightforward operation that uses
standard methods. You will use the following two selection operations most
frequently:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>To select a single object within a view, move the cursor to the object
and click mouse button 1 (the leftmost one).
Once you select an object, any objects previously
selected are unselected automatically.
</LI>
<LI>To select an additional object, move the cursor to the object and
<CODE>&lt;Control&gt;</CODE>+Click (again with the leftmost mouse button).
Previously selected objects remain selected, and
the newly picked object is added to the selection. Notice that the picked item
must belong to the same level as the previously selected objects. An
alternative method for selecting multiple objects is to drag a rectangle
around them. For more information see
<A HREF="#mulobjsel">Drag-selecting Multiple Objects</A></LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Note that the Root object and View objects can not be pick-selected at all.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="mulobjsel"></A> Drag-selecting Multiple Objects</H3>

<P>You can select multiple objects using the <CODE>&lt;Control&gt;</CODE>+Click method
described in section 
<A HREF="#oneobjsel">Selecting Individual Objects</A>.
An additional method for selecting multiple objects is to drag a rectangle
around those objects. However only objects that belong to the current level
can be picked within a drag-selection. If you want to select multiple objects
that belong to another level you must change the current level by either
selecting it in the tree/listbox or by picking one object from that level
on a view.</P>
<P>The procedure for drag-selecting multiple objects also uses a standard method:</P>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Imagine a rectangle that encloses only the objects you want to select.
</LI>
<LI>Click at one corner of the rectangle and, while continuing to press the
mouse button, drag until you have enclosed all the objects.
</LI>
<LI>Release the mouse button. All the valid objects inside or crossing the
rectangle are selected and any objects previously selected are unselected
automatically.</LI>
</OL>
</P>

<P>Note that if you press <CODE>&lt;Control&gt;</CODE> during the drag-selection, objects
that are enclosed by the rectangle will be added to the current selection
instead of replacing it.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="ambobjsel"></A> Ambiguous Picking</H3>

<P>In some cases Ayam is unable to differentiate between the objects you have
selected and other nearby or related objects. This ambiguity can arise as
follows:</P>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Imagine a small square surrounding the cursor. When you click an object,
any other valid objects that fall inside this square are also considered to
be possible selections. For example, if you select an item that is positioned
very close to another one, Ayam may consider both items to be possible
selections.
</LI>
<LI>If your model is three-dimensional (which is likely to happen),
imagine a line that is perpendicular to the screen and that passes through
the cursor and into the model. When you pick an object, any objects that
intersect this line are considered to be possible candidates for selection.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>If the selection is ambiguous Ayam displays a window that contains a list of
the possible candidates for selection (see image below), or, if the
<CODE>"PickCycle"</CODE> option is activated, Ayam just cycles through the
candidate objects by further clicks on the same
position.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.23."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>When a name in the candidate list is selected,
the corresponding object is highlighted. Click <CODE>"Ok"</CODE> when you have
determined which object to select or <CODE>"Cancel"</CODE> to close the list and keep
the previous selection unchanged.</P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="pics/ampick.gif" HEIGHT=166 WIDTH=353  loading="lazy">
</CENTER><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">List of Picking Candidates</FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER>
</CENTER>
</P>
<P>It is also possible to use a double click in the list of selection
candidates to select an object and immediately close the dialog
window. Moreover, as the list of candidates immediately gets the
keyboard focus, the cursor keys and <CODE>&lt;Enter&gt;</CODE> can also be
used to select the object.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.11."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Notes:
<UL>
<LI>While the list of ambiguous candidates is opened no other
objects can be picked within the views.
</LI>
<LI>It is possible to use the <CODE>"Zoom to Object"</CODE> action (shortcut
<CODE>&lt;BackSpace&gt;</CODE>) while the ambiguous select listbox is open to get
a better view of the temporarily selected object.
</LI>
<LI>The tolerance used to determine whether an object should be picked
or not can be adjusted (see <CODE>"PickTolerance"</CODE> in
<A HREF="ayam-8.html#hidprefsp">Hidden Preference Settings</A>).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="selac"></A> <A NAME="ss3.4">3.4</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc3.4">Selecting/Tagging Points</A>
</H2>

<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Select Points"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;t&gt;</CODE>;
for <B>t</B>&thinsp;ag points) may be applied to objects that support
single point editing or read only points.</P>
<P>To select or de-select a point it can directly be clicked upon
or a rectangular region can be dragged with the mouse around the
points in question.</P>
<P>Only points within a certain distance from the mouse pointer
click position will be considered picked (see preference option
<CODE>"Modelling/PickEpsilon"</CODE>).
Points that would be picked will flash in a different color when
the mouse pointer moves over them (this is also controlled by the
preference option <CODE>"Modelling/FlashPoints"</CODE>).</P>
<P>Selected points will be drawn in dark red when the select points
modelling action or a modelling action that would modify the selected
points is active (see the following image).</P>

<P>The selected editable points may be modified subsequently using the
modelling actions Move, Rotate, and Scale; refer also to the discussion in
section 
<A HREF="#objorpnt">Transforming Objects or Selected Points</A>.

</P>
<P>After the pick (the selection of a point), the picked point
will be added to the list of selected points for the selected object.
If the selected point is already in that list it will be removed from
the list instead, the picked point will be deselected.</P>
<P>All points can be selected easily using the keyboard shortcut <CODE>&lt;A&gt;</CODE>.</P>
<P>The list of selected points will not be deleted from the object until
an explicit deselection is performed using the keyboard shortcut
<CODE>&lt;N&gt;</CODE> or if certain modelling tools are used.</P>
<P>The point selection can also be inverted using the keyboard shortcut
<CODE>&lt;I&gt;</CODE>.</P>
<P>All three shortcuts above can be used anytime without interfering
with any other active modelling actions.</P>
<P>Note that the list of selected points is not copied, if the object
is copied using the clipboard. The selection is also not saved to
Ayam scene files. But selected points survive
undo/redo.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.16."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Furthermore, the selection action itself is not an operation
recorded in the undo buffer, thus cannot directly be undone.</P>
<P>The point selection also does not interfere with single point modelling
actions:
It is perfectly legal to select some points, move them using
the move action, then switch to single point editing, edit
some other or even one of the selected points, switch back
to the selection action, add other points to the selection or delete
some points from the selection, switch to rotate, rotate the selected
points and so on.</P>
<P>A bigger number of points may be added to the selection using a
click and drag operation. All points that are inside the rectangular
region defined by the click and drag will be added to the selection.
In fact, this approach is the only way to safely add points to the
selection that occlude each other. Clicking always only adds/removes
single points.</P>
<P>Holding down the <CODE>&lt;Ctrl&gt;</CODE>-key while
dragging the mouse removes all selected points within the rectangular
region defined by the drag from the
selection.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.16.1."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>The exact behaviour of picking multiple points of a NURBS curve or surface
depends on the attribute <CODE>"CreateMP"</CODE>:<BR>
If <CODE>"CreateMP"</CODE> is enabled, picking a multiple point will always
select all points that make up the multiple point.<BR>
If <CODE>"CreateMP"</CODE> is disabled, picking a multiple point will only
select the first of the points that make up the multiple point
(but drag selection can be used to select all points nevertheless).</P>

<P>This action may be invoked to mark a point in space for perusal
of other modelling actions that e.g.&nbsp;rotate or scale about a point.
The marked point will be shown as a little red cross in the view window
(see also the image above).</P>
<P>The keyboard shortcut to invoke the set mark action is <CODE>&lt;a&gt;</CODE>.
This action is also active as intermediate action for e.g.&nbsp;rotate
about, where the keyboard shortcuts <CODE>&lt;r&gt;</CODE>
and then <CODE>&lt;a&gt;</CODE> would be used in a sequence and after
setting the mark, the rotate about action would take over again.</P>

<P>A single click with the left mouse button sets the mark. If grids are
active in the view, the mark will be snapped to the nearest grid coordinates.</P>
<P>Note, that, using a single mouse click, only two dimensional mark
coordinates can be specified. Therefore, in versions prior to 1.21, the
third coordinate was always set to zero upon a click. This is no longer
the case. If the preference option <CODE>"Modelling/GlobalMark"</CODE> is
enabled, the third coordinate is <EM>not</EM> reset anymore. This way all
three coordinates of the mark can be defined by clicking two times in
appropriate views, e.g.&nbsp;first in a
front view for the x and y coordinates and then in a side view for the
missing z coordinate.</P>
<P>The mark can also be set to a point of one of the selected objects by
clicking on it. In this case, the mark coordinates are always immediately
three dimensional.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.21."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>If the mouse is dragged instead of clicked, the mark is set to the
bounding box center of all points in the drag
rectangle.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.25."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>


<P>Additionally, when the set mark action is active, the following keyboard
shortcuts are available:
<UL style="list-style: none; ">
<LI><CODE>&lt;Return&gt;</CODE> accept the current mark (useful, if one
first rotates about a point then decides to also scale about
the same point: <CODE>&lt;ra&gt;</CODE>, drag mouse, <CODE>&lt;sa&gt;</CODE>,
<CODE>&lt;Return&gt;</CODE>, drag mouse ...),</LI>
<LI><CODE>&lt;c&gt;</CODE> set the mark to the center of gravity of all
currently selected objects coordinate systems,</LI>
<LI><CODE>&lt;C&gt;</CODE> set the mark to the center of gravity of all
currently selected points.</LI>
<LI><CODE>&lt;b&gt;</CODE> set the mark to the center of the bounding
box of all currently selected points.</LI>
<LI><CODE>&lt;0&gt;</CODE>&thinsp;&ndash;&thinsp;<CODE>&lt;9&gt;</CODE> open a intermediate
parameter GUI where the three mark coordinate values (separated by spaces) may
be entered.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.30."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></LI>
</UL>

</CENTER>
</P>
<P>The mark may also directly be manipulated using the corresponding view object
property (see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#vat">ViewAttrib Property</A>).</P>
<P>Since Ayam 1.21, the mark may also be set without activating the
set mark action and without interfering with other modelling actions
by double clicking with the rightmost mouse button.</P>
<P>Another way of setting the mark is via the <CODE>"FindU"</CODE> special action
for curves
(see also section 
<A HREF="#finduac">Finding Points on Curves</A>)
or the <CODE>"FindUV"</CODE> special action for surfaces
(see also section 
<A HREF="#finduvac">Finding Points on Surfaces</A>)
.</P>
<P>The mark can also be used to remember an important point in space
and get back to it later using the pan to mark action
(keyboard shortcut <CODE>&lt;.&gt;</CODE>).</P>
<P>The current mark can be cleared by pressing <CODE>&lt;D&gt;</CODE> anytime.</P>
<P>Finally, remember that certain operations like e.g.&nbsp;changing the view
type will also clear the mark.</P>

<H2><A NAME="scalac"></A> <A NAME="ss3.10">3.10</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc3.10">Scaling Objects or Selected Points</A>
</H2>

<P>There are several different actions available to interactively scale
objects or the selected (tagged) points of the selected objects:</P>
<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Scale 3D"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;S&gt;</CODE>, note the
big S!) scales all three axes of the selected objects or
the selected (tagged) points of the selected objects
by the same factor.</P>
<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Scale 2D"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;s&gt;</CODE>)
scales just two axes of the selected objects or
the selected (tagged) points of the selected objects. Those axes are
XY in a Front-view, ZY in a Side-view, and XZ in a Top-view.</P>
<P>It is also possible to restrict the scaling of objects or selected
points to just one axis.
For that <CODE>&lt;x&gt;</CODE>, <CODE>&lt;y&gt;</CODE>, or <CODE>&lt;z&gt;</CODE> must
be pressed right after <CODE>&lt;s&gt;</CODE> (e.g.&nbsp;<CODE>&lt;sx&gt;</CODE> for
scale 1D about x).</P>
<P>Since Ayam 1.17, direct access to the 1D scale modelling actions
<CODE>"Scale X"</CODE> (old shortcut: <CODE>&lt;x&gt;</CODE>),
<CODE>"Scale Y"</CODE> (old shortcut: <CODE>&lt;y&gt;</CODE>), and
<CODE>"Scale Z"</CODE> (old shortcut: <CODE>&lt;z&gt;</CODE>) is no longer available.</P>
<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Stretch 2D"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;T&gt;</CODE>)
works much like <CODE>"Scale 2D"</CODE> but the scale factor for each
axis may be different. Never start this action by a click
near one of the axes to be changed, as this will cause
very big scale factors for the other axis. Try it first with
a centered box by starting from one of the box corners,
then try it once starting on the X-axis.</P>

<P>To edit the points of an object two actions (<CODE>"Edit"</CODE> and
<CODE>"Numeric Point Edit"</CODE>) are available.
Those actions may be applied to objects that support single point
editing only.
Such objects usually draw their selectable points using small white

</P>
<P>In contrast to e.g.&nbsp;the move action, all point edit actions require the
handle of the point to be picked directly.
Only points within a certain distance from the mouse pointer click
position will be considered picked (see preference option

<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Edit"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;e&gt;</CODE>)
works much like the move action, but it moves single points instead of
objects. Since Ayam 1.18 it is possible
to edit points of multiple selected objects (in former versions
only points from the first selected object were considered).</P>
<P>If a multiple point is edited, this action modifies all single
points that make up the multiple point, i.e.&nbsp;it is not possible to
move single points apart from a multiple point using this action.
Temporarily disable the <CODE>"CreateMP"</CODE> property or
explode the multiple point to do that.</P>
<P>If the preference option <CODE>"Modelling/EditSnaps"</CODE> is enabled,
the picked point will be moved to the nearest grid coordinates first,
otherwise the grid just controls the displacement for the edit
action. The snapping can occur in 2D or 3D, depending on the preference
option <CODE>"Modelling/Snap3D"</CODE>.
Moreover, while snapping a point, the mouse pointer will warp to
the new position of the point (so that the user does not lose
track of it). Warping the mouse pointer currently does not work on
Mac OS X Aqua.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="numeditac"></A> </P>
<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Numeric Point Edit"</CODE> (shortcut:
<CODE>&lt;E&gt;</CODE>)
starts an intermediate point selection action and upon a click
with the mouse opens a small window where the coordinates of the
selected editable point(s) may be changed directly by entering
new coordinate values on the keyboard (see image below).
If there are already selected points, the dialog window will
be opened immediately.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.26."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>

</CENTER>
</P>
<P>Nothing will be changed unless the <CODE>"Return"</CODE> key is pressed
in a coordinate entry field or the <CODE>"Apply"</CODE> button is used.</P>
<P>In contrast to the normal point selection action, where further
clicks add points to the selection, clicking on new points, while
the edit point dialog is open, deselects the old point(s),
selects the new point and loads its coordinate values into the
entry fields. In case of multiple selected objects, the deselection
is only performed on the object with a new selection.</P>
<P>Note that the w coordinate setting will be ignored for selected points
that do not have weight information (are not rational).</P>
<P>Using the small menu on top of the coordinate window one can
determine whether editing takes place in local/object space or
global/world space.</P>
<P>This modelling action may affect multiple points of multiple selected
objects.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.18."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Snapping points of different objects together is now possible too:
Just select two objects, start numeric point editing (press <CODE>&lt;E&gt;</CODE>),
pick a point on the first object (where a point of the second object
should be snapped to), the point edit window opens, now drag select
the point of the second object (do <EM>not</EM> use a single click for
selection as this would also load new coordinates) and press apply.</P>
<P>The numeric point editing action also supports read only
points, their coordinates may be retrieved, but applying any values
will have no effect.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.18."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>When applying changes, single coordinate entry fields may be empty to
prevent a change of the corresponding coordinate
value.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.20."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>If a multiple point is edited, this action modifies all single
points that make up the multiple point, i.e.&nbsp;single points can not
be moved apart from a multiple point using the numeric point
edit action. Temporarily disable the <CODE>"CreateMP"</CODE> property or
explode the multiple point to do that.</P>
<P>Notice that the numeric point editing dialog may stay
open all the time.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.4."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Furthermore, it is not necessary that the original
object stays selected while working with the numeric point edit dialog,
other objects may be selected to e.g.&nbsp;infer new point coordinates from
their properties and apply them to the original object.
Furthermore notice that the coordinate values displayed in the numeric
point editing window will not update when the point is modified by
another modelling action (e.g.&nbsp;in another view). Simply click on the point
again in a view where the numeric point editing action is active, to
update the coordinate values in the numeric point editing dialog.</P>
<P>The numeric point edit value fields support Tcl expressions.
This allows e.g.&nbsp;to set a point to
exactly<SMALL TITLE="in the limits imposed by the
floating point data type double"><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL> 1/3 by entering:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<CODE>[expr 1.0/3.0]</CODE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>Even though the dialog may display point coordinates in degraded
accuracy (due to floating point to string conversion)
the original point data is unchanged and its accuracy is not affected
as long as the new data is not applied.

section 
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#prefmisc">Miscellaneous Preferences</A>).</P>

<P>

</H2>

<P>In the NURBS context, weights are mainly used to construct perfect
circles, circular arcs, and spheres. However, they also present
another way of influencing the curves or surfaces shape in relation
to the control point with the weight: Weights smaller than 1.0 repel
the curve or surface from the control point, whereas weights larger
than 1.0 attract the curve or surface to the control point. See
also the following image:</P>

</CENTER>
</P>
<P>To edit the weights of an object two actions (<CODE>"Edit Weights"</CODE> and
<CODE>"Reset Weights"</CODE>) are available.
Those actions may be applied to objects that support single point
editing and support rational coordinates only. Those are
objects of type NCurve, NPatch, and PatchMesh.</P>
<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Edit Weights"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;w&gt;</CODE>)
allows to change the w coordinate of a single point by dragging the
mouse left or right. The initial click always resets the weight to 1.0.
For every 10 pixels the mouse is dragged, a value of 0.1 will be
added to or removed from the weight respectively.
If a grid is active, the 0.1 will be multiplied by the grid value
so that a grid of 0.5 will add/remove weight in terms of 0.05
increments/decrements.<BR>
When the <CODE>&lt;Control&gt;</CODE> key is held down while picking the
control point to edit, the weight will not be
reset.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.25."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>The modelling action <CODE>"Reset Weights"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;W&gt;</CODE>)
resets the w coordinate of the picked point to 1.0. Drag
selection of points to reset is also
possible.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.25."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>In both actions the current weight of a control point is visualized
by color: repelling weights (w&thinsp;&lt;&thinsp;1.0) are drawn in
tones of blue that
get darker as the weight approaches 0.0 and attracting weights
(w&thinsp;>&thinsp;1.0) are
drawn in tones of red that get darker as the weight approaches 3.0.
Control points with zero or invalid weights are drawn in black.
Control points with negative weights are drawn in green.
Control points with no weight (w&thinsp;=&thinsp;1.0) stay white,
see also the figure below.

</P>
<P>There are two actions available for snapping points to the current

<P>The actions are initiated using the shortcuts <CODE>&lt;g&gt;</CODE>

<P>The modelling action <CODE>"FindU"</CODE> (shortcut: <CODE>&lt;u&gt;</CODE>)
may be applied to NURBS curves (objects of type NCurve or

This action may be used to get the corresponding parametric

the corresponding, three dimensional, point on the curve. Drag
selection of breakpoints is also possible. A drag selection

<H2><A NAME="editlocal"></A> <A NAME="ss3.25">3.25</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc3.25">Editing in Local Spaces</A>
</H2>

<P>Normally, all editing takes place in world space and the input
plane of all modelling actions is constrained to the world
XY-, ZY-, or XZ-plane (depending on the type of the
view &ndash; <CODE>"Front"</CODE>, <CODE>"Side"</CODE>, or <CODE>"Top"</CODE> respectively).</P>
<P>However, if a view is <EM>aligned</EM> and switched to <EM>local</EM>,
editing in object space is possible. The input plane of an
aligned local view will match the XY-, ZY-, or XZ-plane of the
local object space, again depending on the type of the view.
Editing and other modelling actions take place in that plane.</P>
<P>This means that in an aligned local view a planar parameter curve of a
Skin object may be edited and the parameter curve is guaranteed to
remain planar all the time, even if both objects, curve and Skin,
are rotated and scaled arbitrarily via their transformation attributes.</P>
<P>Furthermore, grids will also act as if defined in local object space.
Note that in contrast to their normal behaviour, grids can also be scaled
differently in X-window and Y-window coordinates in aligned local views
(if the local object space is deformed this way).</P>
<P>To make a view <EM>object-local</EM> and aligned the object must be selected first.
Now, pressing <CODE>&lt;l&gt;</CODE> <EM>twice</EM> makes the current view object-local
(in external views <CODE>&lt;Ctrl+l&gt;</CODE> can also be used).
In Ayam versions prior to 1.18 the view also needed to be aligned
manually using <CODE>&lt;L&gt;</CODE> (or <CODE>&lt;Ctrl+a&gt;</CODE> in external
views). Since Ayam 1.18, the view is automatically aligned to the
selected object or current level when cycling through the
global/local modes.
Manually aligning a view may still be necessary after certain changes to
the camera of the view e.g.&nbsp;by the rotate view action.
Note that realigning is also always possible by cycling the modelling
mode three times using <CODE>&lt;l&gt;</CODE>.
But let us get back to our local view.</P>
<P>To illustrate local views a little bit further, see the following example
images:</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>A Sweep object with a circular B-Spline curve as cross section (rotated
about the Y-axis by 90 degrees using the transformation attributes) and a
straight standard curve as trajectory.
The Sweep itself is rotated about the Z-axis by 30 degrees. The view is a
front view, the cross section and trajectory are both selected.
Note how inadequate the grid spacing would be to edit the trajectory curve
(it is e.g.&nbsp;near impossible to edit the curve and keep it straight).</P>
<P>&raquo;&thinsp;Press <CODE>&lt;l&gt;</CODE>.</P>

</P>
<P>The view has been switched to level-local using a single press of the
<CODE>&lt;l&gt;</CODE> key (see the modelling mode icon, it is displaying a
<B><CODE>L</CODE></B> in the lower right corner. The view is now aligned to
the 30 degree rotated space of the Sweep object (note the Root object
coordinate system, it is tilted). The grid is also rotated (with respect
to the root coordinate system) but now much more useful for editing the
trajectory, in fact it is perfectly aligned to the trajectory.</P>
<P>&raquo;&thinsp;Press <CODE>&lt;l&gt;</CODE> again.</P>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="pics/local-3.gif" HEIGHT=332 WIDTH=402  loading="lazy">
</CENTER><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">Local (Object) Aligned View</FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER>
</CENTER>
</P>
<P>Now the view is object-local and aligned to the first of the selected
objects (the cross section curve); look at the modelling mode icon,
it is now displaying a <B><CODE>O</CODE></B> in the lower right corner. As the selected
cross section curve was rotated by 90 degrees around the Y-axis, the
front view now displays a circle. Note again the orientation
of the Root object coordinate system. The cross section curve can now
be edited safely, it will stay planar.</P>
<P>Note, that object-local aligned views only align to the first of multiple
selected objects; if all selected objects share the same transformation
attributes, everything is fine, but if not, some objects will be misaligned.</P>
<P>Also remember: when a view is level-local, changing the current level
does not automatically realign the view. If the view is object-local,
changing the object selection will also possibly lead to a misaligned
view. To realign the view after changing the current level or object
selection simply press <CODE>&lt;L&gt;</CODE>. Note that aligning the view changes
the aim point of the view camera to the origin of the respective local
coordinate system which might not be appropriate for modelling purposes;
so, after a selection change, one may want to also zoom the view to the
newly selected object: <CODE>&lt;LO&gt;</CODE>.</P>
<P>Finally, note that aligning views only works for spaces
defined by the transformation attributes, it is <EM>not</EM> possible to
align to e.g.&nbsp;a planar curve that has the default transformation
attributes and is rotated via the control points.</P>
