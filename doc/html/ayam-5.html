<P>This section describes NURBS curve and surface related modelling
tools of Ayam.</P>

<P>Note that pressing the <CODE>&lt;F1&gt;</CODE> key in tool dialog windows
can be used to directly jump to the appropriate
sub-section of this part of the documentation.</P>


<H2><A NAME="ss5.1">5.1</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc5.1">General Remarks</A>
</H2>

<P>All NURBS modelling tools are accessible via the <CODE>"Tools"</CODE> menu of the
main window or the toolbox. In addition, there are also corresponding
scripting interface commands.
See sections 
<A HREF="ayam-6.html#scinurbs">Manipulating NURBS Curves</A>
and 
<A HREF="ayam-6.html#scinurbss">Manipulating NURBS Surfaces</A>.</P>
<P>Many modifying tools work on multiple selected objects and execute
the selected operation on all those selected objects in the order
of their appearance in the current level.</P>
<P>Tools that take only NURBS curves or only NURBS surfaces from the selection
will warn if the selection contains objects of unsuitable type,
but processing will continue regardless.<BR>
In case of an error, however, the processing of multiple selected
objects immediately stops, possibly leaving modified <EM>and</EM>
unmodified objects behind.</P>
<P>If an operation executed successfully on an object, the point selection
may be removed from the object.</P>
<P>The notification
of the selected objects will be run immediately after the tool operation.
The notification of the parent object(s), however,
will be run after processing of all selected objects finished
(for more information on notification, see also section
<A HREF="ayam-8.html#toolobj">The Modelling Concept Tool-Objects</A>).</P>
<P>Tools that create tool objects may use the clipboard to move the
new children around, i.e.&nbsp;the clipboard contents may be lost afterwards.</P>
<P>Most tools open a dialog window where additional operation parameters
can be adjusted, see also the figure below.</P>
<P>

<IMG SRC="pics/tooldialog.gif" HEIGHT=136 WIDTH=309  loading="lazy">
</CENTER><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">Tool Dialog Example</FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER>
</CENTER>

The <CODE>"Ok"</CODE>-button starts the tool and <CODE>"Cancel"</CODE> just closes
the dialog.
Furthermore, the currently set parameters can be tried using the
<CODE>"Preview"</CODE> button.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.30."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
A successful preview will be signaled by a green tick mark on the
button, a failed preview (e.g.&nbsp;caused by unsuitable parameters)
by a red exclamation mark. Note, that the
meaning of the <CODE>"Ok"</CODE>- and <CODE>"Cancel"</CODE>-buttons change, when a
preview was generated (green tick mark present). In this case,
<CODE>"Ok"</CODE> simply closes the dialog and <CODE>"Cancel"</CODE> restores the
selected objects to the state before the dialog opened.
Also note, that repeated use of preview just starts the
tool again on the selected objects in their original state.</P>

<H3><A NAME="cbspt"></A> Circular B-Spline Tool</H3>

</CENTER>

<DL>
<DT><B>Arguments</B><DD>
<P>Radius, Arc, Sections, Order.</P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>This tool creates a non-rational B-Spline curve with
Sections+1+Order (Arc=360.0) or Sections+1+(Order/2) (other Arc values)
control points in the XY-plane. The control points
are arranged in a circle of the given radius, centered around the origin.
This gives the curve a circular appearance (see image above) but it
is <EM>not</EM> a true circle:
If only few control points are used, the radius of the circular curve
is clearly smaller than the specified radius value (see the left curve
in the image above).
Furthermore, shape, parameterisation, and curvature of the
B-Spline curve are not exactly as one would expect from a circle.
To create true circular curves, the NURBCircle tool (see below) should
be used instead.</P>
<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>Sections must be at least 1.</P>
<P>If Arc is 360.0, the first
n control points of the new curve will be identical to the last n
(where n is Order-1). Compare the left and middle curves in the image
above which are of order 4 and 2 respectively, the first having
3 and the latter just having 2-1=1 equal control points.
If Arc is 360.0, the curve will also be marked periodic and the
generation of multiple points will be enabled, so that point edit
actions know that they may need to move two points
(see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#ncurvemp">Multiple Points</A>).</P>
<P>If Arc is smaller than 360.0, the curve will be open, and, as is natural
for a B-Spline curve, will not interpolate the first and last control
points unless the order is 2 (see the right curve in the image above,
which was created with an arc value of 180.0, 10 sections, and order 4).</P>

<H3><A NAME="ncirct"></A> NURBCircle Tool</H3>

</CENTER><P><CENTER><FONT SIZE="-1">A NURBS Circle</FONT></CENTER><P><CENTER>
</CENTER>

<DL>
<DT><B>Arguments</B><DD>
<P>Radius, Arc.</P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The NURBCircle tool creates a circular NURBS curve
of desired radius and arc in the XY-plane, centered around the origin
(see also the image above).
The order of the curve will be 3. The number of control points used
differs according to the arc, e.g.&nbsp;9 points for full circles,
5 for half circles,
3 for a quarter circle.</P>
<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>The NURBS curve created by the NURBCircle tool is rational
(uses weights). This means, editing the curve (e.g.&nbsp;moving control points)
may lead to unpredicted results (the curve does not behave exactly
as wished). If the curve is to be modified further, a closed B-Spline,
created with the Circular B-Spline tool (see above), should be used instead.
Additionally, the created curve will be marked as closed and the generation
of multiple points will be enabled, so that point edit actions know that
they may need to move two points.
See also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#ncurvemp">Multiple Points</A>.</P>
<P>A NURBS circle created by this tool can be used to easily create a
NURBS torus by moving the circle along X a bit and then revolving it.
The amount of movement determines the radius of the torus, whereas
the radius of the circle determines the thickness.</P>

<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>For each selected patch, the TrimRect tool creates a
non-rational, piecewise linear, planar NURBS curve of rectangular
shape in the XY-plane, that fits in the (u, v) parameter space of this NURBS
patch, for use as outer trim curve. See also the image above, depicting a
rectangle for a NPatch defined on the knot intervals<BR>

they may need to move two points.
See also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#ncurvemp">Multiple Points</A>.</P>
<P>If a NPatch object is selected, the new curve will be linked as child
of this NPatch object. Otherwise it will be linked to the current level.</P>
<P>The <CODE>"CreateAt"</CODE> and <CODE>"CreateIn"</CODE> options are ignored.</P>

<DL>
<DT><B>Arguments</B><DD>
<P>The tween curve tool takes two NURBS curves from
the selection and requests a parameter <EM>r</EM>. In addition, an
<EM>append</EM> option can be set.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.29."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The selected NURBS curves will be interpolated (tweened)
and a new curve incorporating features from both of the original curves
will be created. See also the image above.
The parameter <EM>r</EM> defines the ratio of influence of the first and
the second curve (the latter is using a ratio of 1&thinsp;-&thinsp;<EM>r</EM>).
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>

                      |-NCurve2
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If a third curve is selected, the parameter <EM>r</EM> is ignored and this
third curve defines the ratio of influence with its y coordinates.
Unless the <EM>append</EM> option is set, the new curve will be created after
the first curve.</P>
<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>The two curves must be of the same length and order.
They need not be defined on the same knot vector, however.</P>
<P>The interpolation control curve does not need to be compatible with
any of the original curves.</P>
<P>If one of the curves knot vector types is <CODE>"Custom"</CODE> or the
respective knot vector types are different, the resulting
knot vector type will be <CODE>"Custom"</CODE> and the knot values will
also be interpolated/tweened. Otherwise a matching knot vector will be
generated according to the type.</P>
<P>The original NURBS curves will not be deleted by this tool.</P>

scripting interface command 
<A HREF="ayam-6.html#sctweennc">tweenNC</A>
and the related tool for
surfaces 
<A HREF="#tweennpt">Tween Surfaces Tool</A>.</P>
<P>To tween NURBS curve providing objects or incompatible NURBS curve objects,
a Script object must be used, as shown in the distributed example scene

In addition, plugin defined curve object types can support the
revert operation.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.26."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The direction of the selected curves will be
reversed. This tool also reverts the relative knot distances
of NURBS curves
so that for example a NURBS curve defined on the (asymmetric) knot
vector<BR>
[&thinsp;0&thinsp;0&thinsp;0&ensp;0.75&ensp;1&thinsp;1&thinsp;1&thinsp;]<BR>
will get the new knot vector<BR>
[&thinsp;0&thinsp;0&thinsp;0&ensp;0.25&ensp;1&thinsp;1&thinsp;1&thinsp;]<BR>
after reversal. This ensures that the shape of a NURBS curve does not
change during reversal. Interpolating and approximating curves may
change their shape as the underlying interpolation/approximation
algorithms are not direction-invariant.<BR>
For interpolating curves, the end derivatives are also reversed properly.</P>
<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>

<DL>
<DT><B>Arguments</B><DD>
<P>The fairing tool takes a number of NURBS
curves from the selection and requests a tolerance value <I>tol</I>.</P>

<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The control points of the curves will be modified
so that the shape of the curve is somewhat smoother. The movement
of a single control point is restricted by the specified tolerance
value. This can also be used to apply the tool multiple times
until the curve shape meets the requirements.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.28."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>If the option <CODE>"Fair Worst"</CODE> is enabled, only the control point that
would be moved the longest distance will be
modified.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.29."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>If there are selected points, only those will be modified.</P>
<P>See also the example images above where a kink on the leading edge of
a wing profile (a) has been removed by applying the fairing
tool with a tolerance value of 0.1 two times, yielding the lower curve (b).
Compare also the curvature plots of both curves (c and d).</P>

<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>The fairing algorithm uses the four direct and indirect neighboring
control points of each point to process. This poses a problem for the
end points of an open curve. Therefore, the control vector of open
curves will be extended by a simple linear extrapolation algorithm,
so that every point of the original curve
has four neighbors. However, the fairing quality for the first, second,
second to last, and last control point of an open curve will be somewhat
lower.</P>
<P>The original algorithm only delivers optimal results for cubic curves
(of order four), using curves of other degrees will work too but yield
worse results.</P>
<P>Due to the fact that the algorithm uses already faired points as
input points for other points to fair, it is <EM>not</EM> direction invariant
if used on all or multiple neighboring points.
Also, control points already placed on very good if not optimal positions
may be moved away to less favorable positions. Further problems arise
for multiple control points, used to model sharp corners, as the
fairing algorithm does not differentiate between wanted and unwanted
non-continuous curve features.
If in doubt, just select a single control point to fair.</P>

larger values lead to more data points and possibly higher approximation
fidelity but also slower processing. A value of 0 disables the tesselation
completely and the original control points will be used as
approximation input.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.29."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL><BR>

<P>The unclamp surface tool takes a number of NURBS patches from
the selection.</P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The knot vectors of the selected NURBS patches will be
changed so that there are no multiple knots at the respective ends
of the knot vectors. The shape of the patches will not change but the
position of some control points will. The knot types of the patches may
be changed to type <CODE>"Custom"</CODE>.</P>
<P>See also the image above, where a surface of width/height four and both
orders three,
originally defined on the knot vectors:<BR>

<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>Unclamping is <EM>not</EM> an exact reversal of clamping (and vice versa).</P>
<P>Furthermore, as the unclamp operation only works on completely clamped surfaces,
the unclamp tool may need to clamp the surface first.</P>
<P>There are also tools available that unclamp a patch in U or
V direction only.</P>

</CENTER>

<DL>
<DT><B>Arguments</B><DD>
<P>The approximate surface tools take a number of NURBS
surfaces from the selection and request additional parameters. Depending
on the approximation direction determined by the concrete tool selection,
those are a subset or all of: width and height, orders, knot types,
whether to create a closed surface, and tesselation parameters.</P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The surfaces will be modified so that they approximate
their respective original surface shape(s) using a new non-rational NURBS
surface with an adjustable number of new control points and
order(s).<BR>
The data points to approximate are created by tesselating the original
surfaces.
The tesselation parameters control how fine this tesselation shall be,
larger values lead to more data points and possibly higher approximation
fidelity but also slower processing. A tesselation parameter of 0 disables
the tesselation completely and the original control points will be used as
approximation input.</P>

control points in V direction of order three has been approximated by a
periodic non rational surface with 11 control
points and order three.</P>

<H3><A NAME="fairst"></A> Fair Surface Tool</H3>


<P>
<DL>
<DT><B>Arguments</B><DD>
<P>The fair surface tool takes a number of NURBS
surfaces from the selection and requests a mode and a tolerance
value. In addition, a <CODE>"Fair Worst"</CODE> option can be set.</P>

<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>The control points of the surface will be modified
so that the shape of the surface is somewhat smoother. The movement
of a single control point is restricted by the specified tolerance
value. This can also be used to apply the tool multiple times
until the surface shape meets the requirements.</P>
<P>As the surface fairing algorithm is derived from the curve fairing algorithm,
the option <CODE>"Mode"</CODE> allows to select in which direction the
algorithm shall be applied, or, for the modes <CODE>"UV"</CODE> and<CODE>"VU"</CODE>,
in which order the dimensions shall be processed.</P>
<P>If the option <CODE>"Fair Worst"</CODE> is enabled, only the control point that
would be moved the longest distance in each control line in the
currently processed direction will be modified.</P>
<P>If there are selected points, only those will potentially be modified.</P>

<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>The fairing algorithm uses the four direct and indirect neighboring
control points of each point to process. This poses a problem for the
end points of an open surface. Therefore, the control vector of open
surfaces will be extended by a simple linear extrapolation algorithm,
so that every point of the original surface
has four neighbors. However, the fairing quality for the first, second,
second to last, and last control points of an open surface will be somewhat
lower.</P>
<P>The original algorithm only delivers optimal results for cubic surfaces
(of order four), using surfaces of other degrees will work too but yield
worse results.</P>
<P>Due to the fact that the algorithm uses already faired points as
input points for other points to fair, it is <EM>not</EM> direction invariant
if used on all or multiple neighboring points.
Also, control points already placed on very good if not optimal positions
may be moved away to less favorable positions. Further problems arise
for multiple control points, used to model sharp corners, as the
fairing algorithm does not differentiate between wanted and unwanted
non-continuous surface features.
If in doubt, just select a single control point to fair.</P>

<P>The tesselation tool takes all NURBS patches and
NURBS patch providing objects from the selection.</P>
<DT><B>Operation</B><DD>
<P>A modal dialog box (see image above) will pop up,
that allows to select a tesselation method via a drop-down menu
and to tune the corresponding tesselation parameter(s) using a slider and
an entry widget. The initial method and parameter values will be derived
from the <CODE>"TP"</CODE> tag of the first of the selected objects (if it has such
a tag).</P>
<P>The selected or provided NURBS patches will be tesselated with the
chosen method and parameters.
The PolyMesh objects created by the tesselation will immediately be
displayed in all view windows instead of the original objects.
Whenever tesselation method or parameters are changed, the tesselation
will be recomputed and displayed, thus, allowing an immediate estimation
of the tesselation quality and the number of created polygonal elements.</P>
<P>If the option <CODE>"LazyUpdate"</CODE> is enabled,
updates of the tesselation that normally occur while dragging the
slider(s) will be deferred until the mouse button is released.
The initial value of this option will be determined from the
<CODE>"LazyNotify"</CODE> preference setting.</P>
<P>The options <CODE>"UseTexCoords"</CODE> and <CODE>"UseVertColors"</CODE> control processing
of texture coordinates and vertex colors stored as PV tags in the objects
to be tesselated (see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#pvtag">PV Tag</A>).
When enabled, the resulting PolyMesh objects will
also have PV tags of the respective type.<BR>
Note that the PV tags must be named as defined by the hidden preference
options <CODE>"PVTexCoordName"</CODE> and <CODE>"PVColorName"</CODE> respectively. By
default those are set to <CODE>"st"</CODE> and <CODE>"Cs"</CODE>.<BR>
If the <CODE>"UseTexCoords"</CODE> option is enabled, but no matching PV tag
is present, texture coordinates will be generated from the data
provided by a TC tag or (if no TC tag is present) from the knot
values of the NURBS surfaces to be tesselated.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.21."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
See also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#tctag">TC (Texture Coordinates) Tag</A>.</P>
<P>The option <CODE>"UseVertNormals"</CODE> controls processing of
vertex normals stored as PV tags in the objects to be
tesselated (see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#pvtag">PV Tag</A>).
When enabled, the resulting PolyMesh objects will have normals derived
from these tags instead of normals derived from the NURBS surface.<BR>
Note that the PV tags must be named as defined by the hidden preference
option <CODE>"PVNormalName"</CODE>. By default this is set to <CODE>"N"</CODE>, so that
a correct example tag looks like this:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
PV N,varying,n,4,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,1
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>The option <CODE>"RefineTrims"</CODE> controls how many times the trim
curves are to be refined before tesselation for improved tesselation
fidelity along trim edges.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.21."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>

<P>The option <CODE>"Primitives"</CODE> allows to select a primitive
creation method. These methods are explained in greater detail
in section 
<A HREF="#prims">Primitive Creation Methods</A>.</P>
<P>If the <CODE>"Ok"</CODE> button is pressed, the tesselation tool will be
closed and all selected objects will be replaced by their tesselated
counterparts. The original objects will be deleted.<BR>
If referenced/master objects are among the selected objects or their
children, and if any of their references are not selected or a child
of the selected objects (i.e.&nbsp;would not be deleted also), then those
master objects will not be deleted but moved to the clipboard instead.</P>
<P>If the <CODE>"Save"</CODE> button is used, the tesselation dialog will be
closed and <CODE>"TP"</CODE> tags containing
the currently selected method and parameter value will be added
to all selected objects.
These tags can be evaluated later, when the respective
objects are converted to PolyMesh objects (e.g.&nbsp;upon export).
Since Ayam 1.11 the conversion mechanism of objects keeps the
<CODE>"TP"</CODE> tags intact, so that e.g.&nbsp;tesselation parameters saved
to a Sphere or a Revolve object will also be preserved, and can
also be used later when the object will eventually be converted to
a PolyMesh (via a NURBS patch).</P>
<P>If <CODE>"Cancel"</CODE> is used, the dialog will be closed
and all selected objects remain unchanged.</P>
<DT><B>Notes</B><DD>
<P>The tesselation tool will block most other parts of Ayam
while it is running, i.e.&nbsp;it is not possible to change the selection
or run other tools. It is, however, allowed to adjust view parameters
while the tesselation tool is open, to examine the tesselation result
more closely or from different viewing angles.</P>
<P>The values of the parameter slider bounds may be changed by simply entering
values that are out of the current bounds into the respective entry widget,
then pressing the <CODE>&lt;Tab&gt;</CODE> key. Range and resolution of the slider
will be recalculated automatically from the value in the entry widget.</P>
<P>PV tags that do not provide enough data for the surface to be tesselated
will be silently ignored.</P>
<P>The PolyMesh objects created by this tool will <EM>not</EM> be optimized.</P>
<P>The tesselation facility is based on the GLU (V1.3+) NURBS tesselator.</P>

<H4><A NAME="s3"></A> Sampling Methods and Parameters</H4>

<P>Six sampling methods are available:
<OL>
<LI><CODE>"ParametricError"</CODE>
ensures that the distance between the tesselated surface and the original
surface is no point bigger than the value specified by <CODE>"SParamU"</CODE>.
</LI>
<LI>The sampling method <CODE>"PathLength"</CODE> ensures that no edge of a
polygon generated by the tesselation is longer than the value specified
by <CODE>"SParamU"</CODE> and the tesselation method
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"DomainDistance"</CODE> (the default up to 1.22) simply tesselates
the NURBS surface into equally sized pieces with regard to parametric
space; <CODE>"SParamU"</CODE> and <CODE>"SParamV"</CODE> control the number of sampling
points in U and V direction respectively per unit length.
This leads to different numbers of samples for knot vectors
of different total length in parameter space.
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"NormalizedDomainDistance"</CODE>
ensures that the tesselation creates the same number of sample
points (as given via <CODE>"SParamU"</CODE> and <CODE>"SParamV"</CODE>) for
knot vectors of any total length in parameter
space<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.9."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
and
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"AdaptiveDomainDistance"</CODE> additionally adds
sample points depending on the number of control points (width or
height of the patch) to provide a better adaptation to complex
patches.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.9."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"AdaptiveKnotDistance"</CODE> normalizes the number of sample
points to the number of knot intervals and the total length of
the knot vector.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.23."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P><CODE>"SParamU"</CODE> is a parameter for the sampling method above.<BR>
The default value for the sampling method <CODE>"AdaptiveKnotDistance"</CODE> is 3.
Higher values lead to better quality and more tesselated polygons.<BR>
The default value for the sampling method <CODE>"DomainDistance"</CODE> is 8. Higher
values lead to better quality and more tesselated polygons.<BR>
The default value for the sampling method <CODE>"PathLength"</CODE> is 1.5.
Smaller values lead to better quality and more tesselated polygons.<BR>
The default value for the sampling method <CODE>"ParametricError"</CODE> is 0.25.
Smaller values lead to better quality and more tesselated polygons.</P>

<P>Note that <CODE>"SParamU"</CODE> is expressed in object space units for the
<CODE>"PathLength"</CODE> and <CODE>"ParametricError"</CODE> sampling methods.</P>
<P><CODE>"SParamV"</CODE> is just available for the sampling methods
<CODE>"DomainDistance"</CODE>, <CODE>"NormalizedDomainDistance"</CODE>,
<CODE>"AdaptiveDomainDistance"</CODE>, and<BR>
<CODE>"AdaptiveKnotDistance"</CODE>.<BR>
The default value is equal to the respective value of the <CODE>"SParamU"</CODE>
parameter above.</P>
<P>See also the next two images and corresponding tables that allow to
compare the results of four main sampling methods with different parameters.</P>

<H4><A NAME="s3"></A> <A NAME="prims"></A> Primitive Creation Methods</H4>

<P>The primitive creation methods determine, how the OpenGL primitives
sent from the GLU NURBS tesselator (<CODE>GL_TRIANGLES</CODE>, <CODE>GL_TRIANGLE_FAN</CODE>,
<CODE>GL_TRIANGLE_STRIP</CODE>, and <CODE>GL_QUAD_STRIP</CODE>) are turned into polygon faces.
Four primitive creation methods are available:
<OL>
<LI><CODE>"Triangles"</CODE>: the output contains only triangles. Even
if quads are originally emitted from the tesselator, those will be
torn down to triangles.
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"TrianglesAndQuads"</CODE>: the output contains triangles and
possibly quads (as originally emitted from the
tesselator).<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.23."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
Note that quads will be emitted from the tesselator with higher probability
in the <EM>DomainDistance</EM> and <EM>KnotDistance</EM> sampling methods.
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"Quads"</CODE>: the output only contains quads that will be
synthesized from neighboring triangles if they form a planar quad.
The pairing algorithm is not very sophisticated, only one solution
will be tried. Furthermore, triangles without suitable neighbor will
be used to form degenerate quads.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.23."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"QuadrangulatedTriangles"</CODE>: the output contains only quads
that stem from refined/quadrangulated triangles.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.30."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
The input of the quadrangulation are the triangles as created by
the <CODE>"Triangles"</CODE> method. Each triangle will be refined/replaced by three
quads. Four new points will be introduced for that. These new points
will be placed directly on the (still) underlying NURBS surface.
The quads are guaranteed not to be degenerate (contrary to those created by
the <CODE>"Quads"</CODE> method) but they may be non-planar
if the tesselated surface is highly curved and the initial sampling
is sufficiently coarse.<BR>
Degeneracies will be detected and proper actions with regard to normal
interpolation will be taken.<BR>
Vertex colors supplied via PV tags are currently not supported by this method.</LI>
</OL>

primitive creation method results.</P>
