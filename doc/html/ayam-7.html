</H2>

<P>Except for RIB export, all import/export modules of Ayam
are plugins that need to be loaded into the application before possible
usage.
Loading of an import/export plugin may be done in three different ways:
<OL>
<LI><EM>explicitly</EM> via the main menu entry <CODE>"File/Load Plugin"</CODE>,</LI>
<LI><EM>automatically</EM> on application startup via a script (by adding
e.g.&nbsp;<CODE>"plugins/loaddxfio.tcl"</CODE> to the <CODE>"Scripts"</CODE> preference
setting),</LI>
<LI><EM>implicitly</EM> via normal scene IO.
<P>Implicit loading means one can simply use the main menu entries
<CODE>"File/Open"</CODE> and <CODE>"File/Save as"</CODE> (or the corresponding
keyboard shortcuts) and specify a filename with the appropriate
extension (e.g.&nbsp;<CODE>".dxf"</CODE>).<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.13."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
Ayam will then load the matching plugin
(<CODE>"dxfio"</CODE>) and will also open the import (or export) options dialog with
the <CODE>"FileName"</CODE> option already set to the filename chosen before.
Of course, implicit plugin loading requires that the
<CODE>"Plugins"</CODE> preferences are correctly set.</P>

</P>
<P>Note that a successful export of a 3D scene to a different application
not only depends on Ayam but also on the importing
application. For instance, many applications claim to read files in the
Wavefront OBJ format but only import polygonal data or, even worse, only
triangles from such files. By default, Ayam tries to preserve as much
information&thinsp;/&thinsp;design intent as possible in the respective
export format leading e.g.&nbsp;to the use of NURBS in Wavefront OBJ files.
Consequently, to successfully transfer an Ayam scene to a different
application, in some cases, manual conversion of the NURBS objects in
the Ayam scene to polygonal geometry may be necessary.
There is a script provided that helps in doing this (<CODE>"topoly.tcl"</CODE>,
see also section
<A HREF="ayam-6.html#topolytcl">Convert Everything to Polygons</A>).</P>
<P>Ayam is not perfect either, as in most import options material and
animation data is completely ignored.</P>
<P>The following table gives an overview of the file format versions
supported by the various import and export plugins. Import of files
from a different version should be considered unsupported.</P>

<H2><A NAME="imprib"></A> <A NAME="ss7.3">7.3</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc7.3">RenderMan Interface Bytestream (RIB) Import</A>
</H2>

<P>Using the <CODE>"rrib"</CODE> (for <B>R</B>ead <B>RIB</B>) plugin RenderMan
Interface Bytestreams of version 3.0 can be imported into Ayam.
This plugin is based on the Affine library by Thomas E. Burge.
Start importing a RIB using the menu entry
<CODE>"File/Import/RenderMan RIB"</CODE>
(if this menu entry is not available, the
rrib plugin must be loaded using the menu entry
<CODE>"File/Load Plugin"</CODE> first).</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>RIB Primitive Support</H3>

<P>The RRIB plugin supports import of the following geometric
primitives:
<UL>
<LI>Quadrics (Sphere, Disk, Cylinder, Cone, Paraboloid, Hyperboloid, Torus),</LI>
<LI>bilinear and bicubic patches and patch meshes,</LI>
<LI>NURBS patches (with trim curves),</LI>
<LI>(general) polygons and (general) polygon meshes,</LI>
<LI>subdivision meshes (with all tags).</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>Furthermore, the plugin supports reading of CSG, object instances,
archives, light sources (including area-lights), arbitrary linear
transformations (except shear transformations), arbitrary
RiOptions and RiAttributes, shaders (except transformation
shaders and without array arguments), arbitrary primitive variables
(e.g.&nbsp;varying or vertex)<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.7."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
, and procedural objects and delayed read
archives<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.9."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>.<BR>
Texture coordinates will import as TC tags
(see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#tctag">TC (Texture Coordinates) Tag</A>).
The handedness of the scene (set via RiOrientation) is tracked and
converted to the right-handed default of Ayam.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.22."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>The RRIB plugin does not support reading of curves, implicit surfaces
(blobby models) and calls to the RenderMan interface that are not
so much useful for a RIB import like e.g.&nbsp;RiMakeTexture.<BR>
Unsupported geometric primitives and other calls to the RenderMan interface
are silently ignored.</P>
<P>Also note that for NURBS patches and bicubic patch meshes, points of type
"P" will be promoted to "Pw". Points of type "Pz" are not supported
by the plugin. Trimming of NURBS patches by clamping their knot ranges
is also not supported (however, UMM/VMM tags will be created, that contain
the new knot minimum and maximum values).<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.9."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL>
See also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#ummtag">UMM/VMM (U/V Min Max) Tag</A>.</P>
<P>Furthermore, objects of type (general) polygon and polygon mesh will
always be promoted to general polygon meshes.</P>
<P>Object instances are resolved to normal objects while importing.
Instances may be easily created again using Automatic Instancing
(see section 
<A HREF="ayam-8.html#ai">Automatic Instancing</A>).
If there are multiple objects in a RenderMan object instance, an
enclosing Level object will be created.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.22."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Procedural objects will not be evaluated, instead, RiProc objects
will be created, that carry all arguments and create the same
sequence of RIB requests upon export as was read upon import.</P>
<P>Note that in the case of serious syntactic errors of the RIB file
more informative error messages are printed to the stderr channel
of Ayam (which is not redirected to the Ayam console).</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="rribopt"></A> RIB Import Options</H3>

<P>The RIB import may be controlled via different options:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>"ScaleFactor"</CODE>, determines a global scale factor to be applied
to all imported objects.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadFrame"</CODE>, specifies the number of the frame in the RIB
to read. A value of -1 means, all frames are to be read. If a frame
number is specified and this frame does not show up in the RIB as
<CODE>"FrameBegin &lt;yournumber&gt;"</CODE> nothing will be imported.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadCamera"</CODE>: if this is switched on, a Camera object will
be created when the RIB plugin encounters a <CODE>"WorldBegin"</CODE>. You may drag
this camera object onto a perspective View object in Ayam after import
to see through the camera of the imported RIB.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadOptions"</CODE>, controls whether RiOptions are
to be imported from the RIB to the scene. Note that those
RiOptions will overwrite the current global settings in the Ayam scene.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadLights"</CODE>, if this is enabled the lights from the
RIB will be imported.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadMaterial"</CODE>, controls whether material objects
are to be created for the imported objects. All material objects
are created in a special level named <CODE>"Materials"</CODE> in the top level
of the scene. The plugin tries to keep the number of generated
material objects as low as possible by comparing with already
existing materials in this level. This also works with material
objects that exist before the RRIB plugin is invoked (as long as
they reside in this special level).</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadPartial"</CODE>, this option is useful if you want to
import partial RIBs (e.g.&nbsp;archives) that do not
contain a <CODE>"WorldBegin"</CODE>.
Be careful with this option (i.e.&nbsp;use it only if reading of a RIB fails),
as it switches reading of all types of objects on, regardless of
the RIB structure.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadSTrim"</CODE> if switched off, no simple trims (trims that only
run along the border of a NURBS patch and actually do not trim the surface)
will be imported if they are the only trim curves.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"RescaleKnots"</CODE> allows to rescale the knot vectors of
NURBS patches and trim curves so that the distances between different
knots are not smaller than the given value. Using a value of 1.0e-04 leads
to NURBS that may be safely drawn using GLU. The default value 0.0 means
no scaling.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"Progress"</CODE>: displays the progress of the import in terms of
line numbers of the file to import (archives do not advance the
progress).</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="exprib"></A> <A NAME="ss7.4">7.4</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc7.4">RenderMan Interface Bytestream (RIB) Export</A>
</H2>

<P>RenderMan Interface Bytestream (RIB) export is the most important export
module of Ayam and in fact justifies its existence. All features of the
Ayam object and scene structure are supported (hierarchy, CSG, instances,
materials, lights etc.).
Furthermore, Ayam also supports direct rendering from view windows,
rendering in multiple passes for shadow maps, and permanent previews
(where a RenderMan renderer is directly coupled to an Ayam view window).</P>
<P>The documentation on RIB export is spread over the Ayam documentation,
this section gives some general information and otherwise just points
to the real documentation sections.</P>
<P>RIB export is always available, it does not need a plugin to be loaded.
The corresponding main menu entry is <CODE>"File/Export/RenderMan RIB"</CODE>
and the corresponding keyboard shortcut is <CODE>&lt;Ctrl+E&gt;</CODE>.
To control the RIB export and rendering, many options exist that are
documented in section 
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#prefrib">RIB-Export preferences</A>.</P>
<P>There are also some special ways to export RIBs available in the
main menu: <CODE>"Special/RIB-Export"</CODE>; this is documented in
section 
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#mmspecial">Special Menu</A>.</P>
<P>Ayam can not only export scenes as RIB but also call various
RenderMan renderers to directly render the exported RIB files to
the screen or to an image file.
Documentation on how to export/render directly from a view window
can be found in section 
<A HREF="ayam-2.html#vmview">View Menu</A>.</P>
<P>Invoking RIB export is also possible using the scripting interface,
see the section 
<A HREF="ayam-6.html#scwrib">RIB export</A> for more information.</P>
<P>RIB export always honors <CODE>"NoExport"</CODE> tags and the <CODE>"HideChildren"</CODE>
attribute.</P>

<H2><A NAME="impmops"></A> <A NAME="ss7.5">7.5</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc7.5">Mops Import</A>
</H2>

<P>In older versions of Ayam, Mops scenes could be imported using the main
menu entry: <CODE>"File/Import Mops"</CODE>. Since Ayam 1.13 Mops import is
a plugin named <CODE>"mopsi"</CODE>. After loading the plugin, Mops scenes
may be imported using the main menu entry <CODE>"File/Import/Mops"</CODE>.</P>
<P>Ayam is able to import most elements of a Mops scene except for
RiAttributes attached to arbitrary geometric objects,
because attributes and shaders are managed by material objects in Ayam.
However, if a Mops object has a surface or displacement shader,
a material object with the shaders from the Mops object
and its RiAttributes will be automatically created and linked with
the geometric object while importing. Only Mops objects
with surface or displacement shaders are considered because
otherwise a material object would have to be created for every
imported Mops object.
The material objects are named <CODE>"mat0"</CODE>, <CODE>"mat1"</CODE> and so on.
Make sure, that the current scene in Ayam does not contain material
objects with those names, otherwise Mops import will not be able to
create material objects for the scene to import.</P>
<P>The import options <CODE>"ResetDM"</CODE> and <CODE>"ResetST"</CODE> control,
whether GLU display mode and tolerance settings (see sections
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#ncattr">NCurveAttr</A>,
and 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#npattr">NPatchAttr</A>
for more information about display mode and tolerance) of NURBS primitives
should be reset to using global preference values (the default in Ayam)
instead of using the values from the Mops scene file.</P>

<H2><A NAME="impdxf"></A> <A NAME="ss7.6">7.6</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc7.6">AutoCAD DXF Import</A>
</H2>

<P>The <CODE>"dxfio"</CODE> plugin allows to import AutoCAD DXF (drawing interchange
format) files into Ayam with the help of the Dime library (from Systems in
Motion, Kongsberg SIM AS, Norway). This plugin only supports files
up to version 14 of the file format.</P>
<P>Start importing a DXF file using the main menu entry
<CODE>"File/Import/AutoCAD DXF"</CODE>
(if this menu entry is not available, the
dxfio plugin must be loaded using the menu entry
<CODE>"File/Load Plugin"</CODE> first).</P>
<P>Note that the entire DXF file is read into memory before any geometry is
created.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>DXF Entity Support</H3>

<P>The DXF import plugin supports reading of the following DXF entities:
3DFACE, ARC, CIRCLE, ELLIPSE, LINE, SOLID, TRACE, BLOCK, INSERT,
POLYLINE, LWPOLYLINE, and SPLINE. Entities not listed here will
be silently ignored.</P>
<P>3DFACE entities are imported as PolyMesh objects if either only the first
three points are unique (the entity describes a triangle) or the face
is planar else as BPatch objects.</P>
<P>ARC, CIRCLE, and ELLIPSE entities will be read as NCircle objects with
corresponding <CODE>"TMin"</CODE>, <CODE>"TMax"</CODE> parameters (for arcs and ellipses)
and scale transformation values (for ellipses) set.</P>
<P>POLYLINE entities are completely supported:
<UL>
<LI>Polylines will be imported as NCurve objects;</LI>
<LI>PolyMeshes and PolyFaceMeshes will be imported as PolyMesh objects;</LI>
<LI>B-Spline and Bezier surfaces will be imported as NPatch objects.</LI>
</UL>
</P>
<P>LINE, LWPOLYLINE, and SPLINE entities will be imported as NCurve objects.</P>
<P>SOLID and TRACE entities are imported as BPatch objects.</P>
<P>BLOCK and INSERT entities will be converted to appropriate master (referenced)
and instance objects (references).</P>
<P>Bulges and extrusions are <EM>not</EM> supported.</P>

(from Systems in Motion, Kongsberg SIM AS, Norway).</P>
<P>Start exporting to a DXF file using the main menu entry
<CODE>"File/Export/AutoCAD DXF"</CODE>
(if this menu entry is not available, the

<P>Note that the entire Ayam scene is converted to a corresponding
DXF model in memory before it is written to the DXF file.</P>
<P>Ayam only creates entities of type POLYLINE and SPLINE and misses very
much information that could be saved to other formats (e.g.&nbsp;normals and
texture coordinates). Therefore, the DXF export format should be avoided
if possible.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>Ayam Object and Properties Support</H3>

<P>The export functionality of the dxfio plugin currently covers
export of all boxes, quadrics, NURBS, PolyMeshes, instances, clones, script
objects (of type <CODE>"Create"</CODE> or <CODE>"Modify"</CODE>), and objects that
may be converted to NURBS curves or surfaces or to PolyMeshes.
However, all boxes and quadrics will always be converted to NURBS surfaces
and NURBS surfaces will be tesselated to PolyMeshes for export.</P>
<P>The scene hierarchy and CSG operations are fully ignored, all objects will
be written as if combined by the union operator.</P>
<P>All transformations will be applied to the control points of the
exported objects.</P>
<P>PolyMesh objects will be exported to POLYLINE (subtype PolyFaceMesh) entities.
If a PolyMesh object contains faces with holes or with more than four
points, it will be tesselated for export. Eventually existing normals
will not be exported.</P>
<P>NURBS curves will be exported as SPLINE entities.</P>
<P>Instance objects are resolved for export.</P>
<P>Light sources, as well as Cameras, Views, and Materials are not exported.</P>

a Disk). In all other cases and also for Cones, the <CODE>"Closed"</CODE>
attribute of the Ayam object is set according to the cap information of
the X3D element.</P>
<P>ElevationGrids are imported as bilinear patch meshes.</P>

</LI>
<LI><B>Geometry2D:</B>
Arc2D, ArcClosed2D, Circle2D, Disk2D, Polyline2D.

<P>Arcs and Circles are imported as NCircle objects.
Closed arcs and Polylines are imported as NURBS curves.
Disks with an inner radius > 0.0 are imported as flat Hyperboloids
(otherwise as Disks).</P>

</LI>
<LI><B>NURBS:</B>
NurbsCurve, NurbsCurve2D, NurbsPatchsurface,
NurbsTrimmedSurface, Contour2D, ContourPolyline2D,
NurbsSweptSurface, NurbsSwungSurface, NurbsSet.

<P>All NURBS elements are fully supported.</P>

</LI>
<LI><B>CAD:</B>
QuadSet, IndexedQuadSet, CADLayer, CADAssembly, CADPart, CADFace.

<P>CADLayer objects will be imported as top level Level objects.
CADAssembly and CADPart objects will be imported as level objects.</P>

</LI>
<LI><B>Light sources:</B>
DirectionalLight, PointLight, SpotLight.

<P>The lights will be directly mapped to the standard RenderMan
light sources distant, point, and spot, respectively.
Therefore, the <CODE>"radius"</CODE> and the <CODE>"attenuation"</CODE> attributes
of point and spotlights are not supported. However, point and spotlights
still have a quadratic falloff with distance.</P>

</LI>
<LI><B>Navigation:</B>
Viewpoint.

<P>Viewpoint elements will be imported as view objects (with corresponding
view window) or camera objects depending on the <CODE>"ReadViewpoints"</CODE>
import option.</P>

</LI>
<LI><B>Non geometric&thinsp;/&thinsp;Scene structure:</B>
Transformation, Shape, Group, StaticGroup, Inline.

<P>Shear transformations are not supported.</P>
<P>The semantics for inlining are currently not fully standards compliant.
By default, DEFs in inlined files live in their own namespace.
It is not possible to USE a DEF from an inlined file in the
inlining file.
However, if the <CODE>"MergeInlineDefs"</CODE> import option is switched on,
<EM>all</EM> DEF namespaces (of inlining and inlined files) will be
merged into one big namespace.
Now it would be possible to USE a DEF from an inlined file in the
inlining file. But beware, this only works correctly, if the DEF
names in all the files are unique.
It is not possible to transfer single definitions from an inlined file
to the inlining file or from the inlining file to the inlined file.</P>
<P>Also note: Inline URLs that do not point to the file system are not
supported.</P>

<H3>X3D Attribute Support</H3>

<P>The <CODE>"solid"</CODE>, <CODE>"ccw"</CODE>, and <CODE>"convex"</CODE>
attributes are always ignored.</P>
<P>The <CODE>"DEF"</CODE> and <CODE>"USE"</CODE> attributes are supported for all
elements, however, the corresponding master-instance relationships are
completely resolved upon import.
Instances of objects may be easily created again using Automatic Instancing
(please refer to section 
<A HREF="ayam-8.html#ai">Automatic Instancing</A>).</P>
<P>Normals will currently not be generated automatically for any X3D element
and thus the <CODE>"creaseAngle"</CODE> attribute will be fully ignored.
Note however, that if normals are specified explicitly, e.g.&nbsp;for an
<CODE>"IndexedFaceSet"</CODE> element, they will be imported correctly.</P>
<P>Furthermore, if normals, colors, or texture coordinates
are provided to an element that imports as a PolyMesh (IndexedFaceSet
and the likes) proper PV (primitive variable) tags will be
created.<SMALL TITLE="Since 1.17."><SUP>&lsqb;&lowast;&rsqb;</SUP></SMALL></P>
<P>Moreover, if there is an index provided to the normals, colors, or
texture coordinates, the relevant affected data (e.g.&nbsp;the vertex
coordinates) will be expanded properly (as RenderMan does not support
multiple different indices on the vertex related data).
Note that currently the mere presence of an index will lead to this expansion.
The potential normal, color, or texture coordinate index is not checked for,
whether it is identical to the vertex coordinate index (and thus no expansion
would be necessary in the first place).</P>
<P>The <CODE>"DEF"</CODE> attributes will be converted to object names
in some cases.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="impx3dopt"></A> X3D Import Options</H3>

<P>The following options further control the X3D import process:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>"FileName"</CODE>: is the name of the X3D file to be imported</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadCurves"</CODE>: if this is disabled, no freeform curves will
be imported. This option does <EM>not</EM> influence the import of trim
curves.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadViewpoints"</CODE>: controls whether viewpoints should
be read as view, camera, or not at all.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ReadSTrim"</CODE>: if switched off, no simple trims (trims that only
run along the border of a NURBS patch and actually do not trim the surface)
will be imported if they are the only trim curves.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"RescaleKnots"</CODE>: allows to rescale the knot vectors of
NURBS curves, patches, and trim curves so that the distances between different
knots are not smaller than the given value. A <CODE>"RescaleKnots"</CODE> value of
1.0e-04 leads to NURBS that may be safely drawn using GLU.
The default value 0.0 means no scaling.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ScaleFactor"</CODE>: allows to apply a scaling factor to all
imported objects.</LI>
<LI><CODE>"RationalStyle"</CODE>: determines how rational coordinates are
stored in the file to be imported
(see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-1.html#rats">Rational Style</A>);</LI>
<LI><CODE>"Progress"</CODE>: displays the progress of the import;
from 0 to 50 percent, the x3dio plugin is reading the XML file,
from 50 to 100 percent the x3dio plugin is creating Ayam objects.</LI>
</UL>
</P>

<H2><A NAME="expx3d"></A> <A NAME="ss7.15">7.15</A> <A HREF="ayam.html#toc7.15">X3D (Web3D) Export</A>
</H2>

<P>Since version 1.13 Ayam provides a plugin named <CODE>"x3dio"</CODE> that exports
scenes to the XML based X3D file format published by the Web3D Consortium.
The XML parser used in this plugin is based on Expat and SCEW.</P>
<P>Start exporting to a X3D file using the menu entry
<CODE>"File/Export/Web3D (X3D)"</CODE>
(if this menu entry is not available, the
x3dio plugin must be loaded using the menu entry
<CODE>"File/Load Plugin"</CODE> first).</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>Ayam Object and Properties Support</H3>

<P>The export functionality of the x3dio plugin currently covers
export of all boxes, quadrics, NURBS, PolyMeshes, instances, clones, script
objects (of type <CODE>"Create"</CODE> or <CODE>"Modify"</CODE>) and objects that
may be converted to NURBS curves or surfaces or to PolyMeshes
(e.g.&nbsp;SDMesh objects).</P>
<P>Some NURBS tool objects can be exported as parametric NURBS nodes,
e.g.&nbsp;Sweep objects may be exported as NurbsSweptSurface nodes.</P>
<P>The scene hierarchy (level objects) will be converted to a
matching transform node hierarchy.</P>
<P>CSG operations are fully ignored, all objects will be written as
if combined by the union operator.</P>
<P>Clamping the knot ranges of NURBS via UMM/VMM tags is not supported.</P>
<P>NURBS surfaces support XML tags to set <CODE>"uTesselation"</CODE> and/or
<CODE>"vTesselation"</CODE> attributes.</P>
<P>PolyMesh objects will be exported to IndexedFaceSet nodes.
PolyMesh faces with holes are automatically tesselated. PolyMesh faces
with more than three points are tesselated if the export option
<CODE>"TessPoMesh"</CODE> is used.
All tesselated faces will be exported to a second IndexedFaceSet
element.</P>
<P>Light sources are exported if they are point, distant, or spot lights.</P>
<P>Cameras and Views are exported as Viewpoint nodes. Note however, that
X3D always assumes a perspective viewing transformation. This means,
views of type <CODE>"Front"</CODE>, <CODE>"Side"</CODE>, or <CODE>"Top"</CODE> will not be
exported properly.</P>
<P>Material objects are supported in a very minimalist way,
i.e.&nbsp;only the material color will be exported as <CODE>"diffuseColor"</CODE>
attribute.
However, XML tags can be used to add more attributes or even shaders to the
exported materials, see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-4.html#xmltag">XML tag</A>.</P>
<P>Object names will be converted to DEF attributes.</P>
<P>Instances can be resolved or exported as USE/DEF pairs.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3>Wire-frame Support</H3>

<P>The X3D export allows to export wire-frames instead of surfaces for
NPatch and PoMesh objects.</P>
<P>To switch an object to wire-frame export, just add a tag <CODE>"AsWire"</CODE>
to the object.</P>

<div style="height: 0.5em">&nbsp;</div>
<H3><A NAME="expx3dopt"></A> X3D Export Options</H3>

<P>The following parameters, additionally, control the X3D (Web3D) export:
<UL>
<LI><CODE>"FileName"</CODE>: is the filename of the X3D file;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ScaleFactor"</CODE>: allows to apply a scaling factor to all
exported objects (this will be realized by an extra <CODE>Transform</CODE>-node
in the scene hierarchy);</LI>
<LI><CODE>"WriteSelected"</CODE>: if enabled, only the currently selected
object(s) will be exported;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ObeyNoExport"</CODE>: toggles export of objects with <CODE>"NoExport"</CODE>
tags;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"IgnoreHidden"</CODE>: toggles export of hidden objects;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"WriteCurves"</CODE>: toggles writing of NURBS curves and
NURBS curve providing objects to the exported file (This option does
<EM>not</EM> influence the export of trim curves.);</LI>
<LI><CODE>"WriteViews"</CODE>: controls whether views should be exported as
view points;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"WriteParametrics"</CODE>: toggles writing of the following
tool objects as plain NURBS surface or the following higher level
primitives:
<UL>
<LI>Revolve as NurbsSwungSurface,</LI>
<LI>Swing as NurbsSwungSurface,</LI>
<LI>Sweep as NurbsSweptSurface,</LI>
<LI>Extrude as NurbsSweptSurface;</LI>
</UL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"WriteMaterials"</CODE>: controls whether appearance and
material nodes should be exported for each shape;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"ResolveInstances"</CODE>: controls whether instance objects should
be resolved to normal objects or exported as DEF/USE pairs. Note, that no
attempt is made to detect whether the master objects (the DEFs) will be
exported for all exported instances (USE); this may happen especially in
conjunction with the X3D export options <CODE>"WriteSelected"</CODE> or
<CODE>"IgnoreHidden"</CODE>, incomplete/erroneous X3D files may
result unless the
<CODE>"ResolveInstances"</CODE> option is switched on;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"TopLevelLayers"</CODE>: arranges for all top level
objects in the Ayam scene to be exported as <CODE>CADLayer</CODE>-nodes,
instead of <CODE>Transform</CODE>-nodes;</LI>
<LI><CODE>"RationalStyle"</CODE>: determines how to write rational coordinates
(see also section 
<A HREF="ayam-1.html#rats">Rational Style</A>);</LI>
<LI><CODE>"WriteX3dom"</CODE>: toggles X3DOM-export mode. If this option is
enabled, the X3D export will
<OL>
<LI>first read a XHTML template file from the export target directory
(named <CODE>"x3dom-template.xhtml"</CODE>),</LI>
<LI>then inject the scene to be exported into the
X3D <CODE>"&lt;Scene&gt;"</CODE>-tag of the template (already present child
elements of this tag will be preserved),</LI>
<LI>add width and height of the view window that was exported last
as attributes to the <CODE>"&lt;X3D&gt;"</CODE>-tag,</LI>
<LI>and finally write the XHTML document to the file
specified via the <CODE>"FileName"</CODE> export option.</LI>
</OL>
</LI>
<LI><CODE>"Progress"</CODE>: displays the progress of the export;
from 0 to 50 percent, the x3dio plugin is creating a XML document
in memory and from 50 to 100 percent this XML document will be written
to the X3D file.</LI>
